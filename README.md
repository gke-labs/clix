# clix

Running CLIs via containers, and using container images as the distribution method.

`clix` makes it easy to "install" tools into your path, and takes care of downloading them and running them in whatever sandbox is available (Mac, Windows, Linux, inside a container like a kubernetes pod etc).

We support selective sandboxing, so (for example) the AWS CLI won't need access to your gcloud credentials, and the gcloud CLI won't need access to your AWS credentials.
